# hog-cell-detection-framework

Cell detection framework based on HOG feature descriptors and iterative training. The framework is programmed in Python by using OpenCV's implementation of HOG descriptor and scikit-learn's implementation of SVM.

The framework was produced during a masterâ€™s thesis work that was carried out at the Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology (TUT), during 2014. The master's thesis is available online: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tty-201412021562

A research article _"Training based cell detection from bright-field microscope images"_ summing up the essence of the thesis was accepted to the Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA) 2015 conference: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2015.7306051.
