Cell detection framework based on HOG feature descriptors and iterative training. The framework is programmed in Python by using OpenCV's implementation of HOG descriptor and scikit-learn's implementation of SVM.

The framework was produced during a masterâ€™s thesis work that was carried out at the Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology (TUT), during 2014. The master's thesis is available online: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tty-201412021562. You can freely use and edit the code, but please cite the source. The code is located under /Source/ tab on this website and links to the microscope images are located on the left-hand side panel of /Project Home/ tab.
